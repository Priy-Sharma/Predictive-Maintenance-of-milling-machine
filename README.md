# Predictive-Maintenance-of-milling-machine
The project focuses on predictive maintenance of milling machines, aiming to minimize downtime and maintenance costs by predicting potential failures before they occur. This is achieved through a classification model that can categorize the machine's operational status and identify signs of imminent failure.
